Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nandy, I've spent the last 6 years in the footballsphere doing everything from scouting, writing to data analysis. I'm currently doing data work at <a href="https://afreconscout.com/">Afrecon</a>

You might know me from <a href="https://twitter.com/nandy_sd">Twitter</a> or my blog posts on <a href="https://sagnikdas1.medium.com/">Medium</a> . This github website is where I am attempting to curate all of my work into one place. You can find scouting reports, analysis projects among other things here.
