Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nandy, I've spent the last 6 years in the footballsphere doing everything from scouting, writing to data analysis. I'm currently doing data work at [Afrecon](https://afreconscout.com/)

You might know me from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nandy_sd) or my blog posts on [Medium](https://sagnikdas1.medium.com/). This github website is where I am attempting to curate all of my work into one place. You can find scouting reports, analysis projects among other things here. 

## Scouting Reports 
1. [Manuel Locatelli](https://sagnikdas1.medium.com/manuel-locatelli-passing-savant-d1c73d3ac845) | Medium | Jul 17, 2020

## Analysis Projects

1. [Measuring Freedom](https://sagnikdas1.medium.com/measuring-freedom-87cfdf39bb0c) | Dec 29,2020 \
This was a project where I attempted to quanitify freedom i.e. put a mathematical number behind how free a playerâ€™s role truly is.

2. [Scraped Understat Data and made it open source for the analytics community](https://sagnikdas1.medium.com/glossary-3b3e67515375) \
<em>This was done only after obtaining permission through email via Understat. If anybody involved with Understat or their data providers have issues with the release of this data, reach out to me on Twitter by tagging or DMing me, and I will take it down.</em>
