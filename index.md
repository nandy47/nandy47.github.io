Hi there 👋, I'm Nandy, I've spent the last 6 years in the footballsphere doing everything from scouting, writing to data analysis. I'm currently doing data work at [Afrecon](https://afreconscout.com/)

You might know me from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nandy_sd) or my blog posts on [Medium](https://sagnikdas1.medium.com/). This github website is where I am attempting to curate all of my work into one place. You can find scouting reports, analysis projects among other things here.
