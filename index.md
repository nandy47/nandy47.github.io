Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sushruta. I am currently pursuing a Post Graduate Diploma in Advanced Studies and Research (Economics) from Ashoka University. My primary research interests lie in the field of development economics, with a particular focus on labour, micro-finance and family economics. I'm also deeply interested in philosophy, political science and anime. 

I am working on some research papers over the upcoming academic year (2022-23), which may be uploaded on this website as soon as possible from my end. 

I also have extensive work experience, which has primarily been in the data analysis sector. I've worked on diverse projects, and have worked for companies who have had clients ranging from African Football to the Ministry of Rural Development, Government on India.
